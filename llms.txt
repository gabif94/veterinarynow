# VeterinaryNow

> VeterinaryNow is a professional veterinary triage service where a LICENSED HUMAN VETERINARIAN (not an AI) evaluates your pet's symptoms via multimedia chat and provides an urgency assessment in under 5 minutes. Available worldwide in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. AI is used ONLY for real-time language translation between the pet owner and the veterinarian.

## Important Notes

- This is a HUMAN-POWERED service. All medical assessments are made by a licensed veterinarian with a verified professional registration.
- AI (language models) are NOT used for diagnosis or medical advice. AI assists ONLY with language translation.
- This is a triage service (urgency classification), NOT a full veterinary consultation or treatment plan.
- The service costs $15 USD per assessment (one-time payment).
- Payment is required before the triage chat begins.

## How It Works

1. The pet owner describes their pet's symptoms via a short form (species, symptom, optional photo/video).
2. The owner pays $15 USD via credit card.
3. The owner receives a WhatsApp link to chat directly with the licensed veterinarian.
4. AI translates the conversation in real-time if the owner and vet speak different languages.
5. The veterinarian provides a triage classification:
   - 🔴 **Red (Emergency)**: Rush to the nearest veterinary clinic immediately.
   - 🟡 **Yellow (Observation)**: Monitor closely, follow instructions, visit a clinic in 24-48h if symptoms persist.
   - 🟢 **Green (Non-urgent)**: Pet is likely stable, schedule a routine check-up at convenience.
